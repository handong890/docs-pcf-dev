### Running PCF Dev behind an HTTP proxy

In a restricted network environment, configuring PCF Dev to connect to a proxy permits app-to-internet connectivity, access to custom buildpacks, and the use of Docker images from the public internet.

To use PCF Dev behind a proxy, first install the vagrant-proxyconf plugin:

```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxyconf
```

#### OS X

Specify your HTTP proxy when starting PCF Dev:

```
$ HTTP_PROXY=http://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT \
    HTTPS_PROXY=http://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT \
    ./start-osx
```

#### Windows (powershell)

Specify your HTTP proxy when starting PCF Dev:

```
>> $env:HTTP_PROXY = "http://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT"
>> $env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT"
>> .\start-windows.ps1
```

### Other Options

Traffic to the host will not go through the proxy. To connect to other addresses without using the proxy set the `NO_PROXY` environment variable to a comma separated list of hosts. You may want to do this in the case where you are connecting apps to user-provided services on a private network.

### Advanced Usage (Vagrant)

The `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables can also be used when running `vagrant up` instead of using the start script.
