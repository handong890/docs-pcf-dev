### Running PCF Dev behind an HTTP proxy
Install the vagrant-proxyconf plugin as follows:

$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxyconf

#### OS X

Specify your HTTP proxy when starting PCF Dev:

$ HTTP_PROXY=http://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT \
    HTTPS_PROXY=http://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT \
    start-osx

#### Windows (powershell)

$ $env:HTTP_PROXY = "http://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT
$ $env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT
$ start-windows.ps1

The `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables can also be used when directly running `vagrant up` instead of using the start script

Traffic to the host will not go through the proxy. To connect without proxying to additional hosts set the NO_PROXY environment variable with a comma separated list of hosts. You may want to do this in the case where you are connectings apps to user provided services on a private network.

These proxy options allow app-to-internet connectivity, and access to custom buildpacks and dockers images from the public internet, while running behind a corporate proxy.
